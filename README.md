latvian-namedays-osx-widget
===========================

Platform: OS X  
Versions supported: 10.4.3 and newer

Latvians have a peculiar tradition of celebrating one's namedays as well as their birthdays, in fact,
great importance is put upon this celebration. For that reason it is just as important to keep track
of which name falls upon which day.

This is an OS X widget I made sometime about 2006, hosted on my now defunct website for some time, and
now I've dusted it off and present it to the general public here.

It was working on OS X 10.4.3 and it works now on 10.8.3 so it's safe to assume that all of the OS X versions
inbetween are supported as well.

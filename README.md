**Latvians have a peculiar tradition of celebrating one's namedays as well as their birthdays, in fact,
great importance is put upon this celebration. For that reason it is just as important to keep track
of which name falls upon which day.**

This is an OS X widget I made sometime about 2006, hosted on my now defunct website for some time, and
now I've dusted it off and present it to the general public here.

It was working on OS X 10.4.3 and it works now on 10.8.3 so it's safe to assume that all of the OS X versions
inbetween are supported as well.

**[Download link](https://github.com/pilsetnieks/latvian-namedays-osx-widget/blob/master/Names.1.0.3.zip)**  
Platform: OS X  
Versions supported: 10.4.3 and newer

##### Note about installation on OS X 10.8

Depending on your computer settings you may be asked whether you want to install this application from an
unidentified developer. That is because 10.8 has a new security measure where it asks applications to be
digitally signed by their developers. While this feature is actually pretty good, unfortunately, it is
currently not possible to sign a widget in any way.

However, you can examine the code (there's very little of it) and see for yourself that there is nothing
threatening there at all.

To avoid the warning, just right-click on the widget icon and agree to the confirmation about installing
the widget.

##### About widget source code

[latvian-namedays-osx-widget.dcproj](https://github.com/pilsetnieks/latvian-namedays-osx-widget/tree/master/latvian-namedays-osx-widget.dcproj)
is the Dashcode project for this widget, however the source code alone is also available in the
[src](https://github.com/pilsetnieks/latvian-namedays-osx-widget/tree/master/src) directory.
